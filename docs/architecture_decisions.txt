Architecture Decisions

Message passing techniques adopted were:
1) REST APIs
REST was chosen because it is the most easiest form of
message passing that leverages a comparatively high throughput in API performance.

2) Message Queues (Kafka)
- For ingesting large volume of location data from the mobile devices the gRPC technique was chosen.
- It provides improved performance with regard to reduction in overall payload sizes and
connection overhead and hence ensures that the proposed solution might be
able to handle large volume of data from many devices.

3) gRPC
- A message queue (Kafka) was used by the location ingester service to handle the location data.
- It improves performance, reliability and using this message queue along with gRPC for the ingestion of
location data from the mobile device gives multidimensional advantage due to the benefits
derivable from the two message passing techniques.
- The decision to use Kafka over other messaging queues
like RabbitMQ is to ensure that we utilize a durable distributed queue.
