Architecture Decisions

Message passing techniques adopted were:
1) REST APIs
2) Message Queues (Kafka)
3) gRPC

REST was chosen because it is the most straightforward form of message passing that leverages
a relatively high throughput in API performance.

gRPC was chosen for ingesting large volume of location data from the mobile devices.
The choice was made to leverage on the improved performance provided by gRPC with regard to
reduction in overall payload sizes and connection overhead and thus ensures that the proposed solution will be
able to handle large volumes of data from many devices.

A message queue (Kafka) was used by the location ingester service to handle the ingested location data.
This improves performance, reliability and also enable decoupling of our systems.
Using the message queue in conjunction with gRPC for the ingestion of location data from the mobile device gives multidimensional advantage due to the benefits
derivable from the two message passing techniques. The decision to use Kafka over other messaging queues
like RabbitMQ is to ensure that we utilize a durable distributed queue.
